/*
problem statement:-
A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null.

Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --> Y, then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, x.random --> y.

Return the head of the copied linked list.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:

val: an integer representing Node.val
random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) that the random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.
Your code will only be given the head of the original linked list.

//
// Here's how the 1st algorithm goes.
// Consider l1 as a node on the 1st list and l2 as the corresponding node on 2nd list.
// Step 1:
// Build the 2nd list by creating a new node for each node in 1st list. 
// While doing so, insert each new node after it's corresponding node in the 1st list.
// Step 2:
// The new head is the 2nd node as that was the first inserted node.
// Step 3:
// Fix the random pointers in the 2nd list: (Remember that l1->next is actually l2)
// l2->random will be the node in 2nd list that corresponds l1->random, 
// which is next node of l1->random.
// Step 4:
// Separate the combined list into 2: Splice out nodes that are part of second list. 
// Return the new head that we saved in step 2.
